# Personal Homepage Visual Design Scheme

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Overall Visual Direction

A sophisticated and secure digital aesthetic that communicates technical prowess and professional reliability. The design draws inspiration from the clean, dark-themed interfaces of cybersecurity platforms and the minimalist yet futuristic visuals of 'Ex Machina'. The core idea is to create a digital fortress that is both impressive and trustworthy, reflecting a career built on securing the digital world.

### Content Density

Medium density. The design prioritizes clarity and visual impact, with each section dedicated to a single, key message or skill set. Ample whitespace (20%-25%) enhances the feeling of precision and focus, mirroring the analytical nature of cybersecurity.
